## 💻 Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pmm-research-agent.git
cd pmm-research-agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

#### Option A: Environment Variables

```bash
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your DeepSeek API key (and Groq as fallback)
```

#### Option B: Streamlit Secrets

Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY = "your-deepseek-api-key-here"  # primary backend
GROQ_API_KEY = "your-groq-api-key-here"          # fallback backend
TAVILY_API_KEY = "your-tavily-api-key-here"      # required for web search
research_mode = "aggressive"
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering

The agent uses a carefully crafted system prompt that ensures consistent, PMM-focused outputs:

```
You are a Principal PMM Strategist with deep expertise in product marketing, 
competitive analysis, and go-to-market strategy.

Your task is to provide a comprehensive, structured research report that PMMs 
and GTM leaders can immediately use for strategic decision-making.

ALWAYS structure your response in exactly this format:
1) Trends, 2) Competitor Examples, 3) Conflicts, 4) Recommendations, 5) Citations
```

Modify this in `deep_research.py` if needed.

- **DeepSeek Reasoner** is the primary backend for all research queries.
- **Groq compound-beta** is used as a fallback if DeepSeek is unavailable or rate-limited.
- Prompts are always loaded from external files for both basic and advanced modes.
- Caching ensures cost control and fast repeat queries.
