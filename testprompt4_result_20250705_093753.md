**Key Strategic Implications:**  
Sage Intacct's healthcare play requires doubling down on compliance messaging while addressing two primary friction points: 1) Legacy system integration costs, and 2) SMB price sensitivity. The competitive window exists between QuickBooks (too limited) and NetSuite (too broad). Immediate opportunities include developing healthcare-specific implementation accelerators and creating quantifiable compliance ROI models leveraging HFMA partnerships.
