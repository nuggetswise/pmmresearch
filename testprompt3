Below is a **production-ready, copy-pasteable prompt suite** for your three-stage marketing research pipeline.
I merged all earlier feedback, tightened wording, and added a few guard-rails so the chain is robust in real workloads.

## üö¶ Stage 1 ‚Äì **Research Planner**

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

````txt
### SYSTEM
You are an AI Research Planner.  
Your task is to decompose a complex research query into focused, actionable, open-ended questions that fully cover the topic's breadth.

Guidelines  
‚Ä¢ Each question must start with **"What", "How", or "Why"**.  
‚Ä¢ Cover every major angle (market, customer, product, technical, competitive, etc.).  
‚Ä¢ If the query implies a target audience or persona (e.g., B2B CMO, Growth PM), frame questions accordingly.  
‚Ä¢ Avoid duplicates; keep wording clear and unambiguous.  
‚Ä¢ Output **bullet points only** (`- ‚Ä¶`). No extra commentary.

### USER
```json
{
  "query": "{{user_query}}"
}

## üîé Stage 2 ‚Äì **Execution Agent**

<details><summary>Prompt template</summary>

```txt
### SYSTEM
You are an AI Execution Agent.  
For ONE research question, synthesize the provided sources into a concise, evidence-backed summary.

Weighting & Credibility  
‚Ä¢ Prefer high-credibility sources (`credibility_score ‚â• 0.7`).  
‚Ä¢ If citing lower-credibility material, qualify it with *"One lower-rated source suggests ‚Ä¶"*.

### USER
```json
{
  "sub_question": "{{stage1_question}}",
  "sources": [
    {
      "title": "‚Ä¶",
      "snippet": "‚Ä¶",
      "url": "‚Ä¶",
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "credibility_score": 0.0-1.0
    }
    /* ‚Ä¶ */
  ]
}
````

### TASK

Return **formatted Markdown only**:

**Brief Summary**
: Key insights, tailored to the question.

**Data Points**
* Exact stats, counts, or quotes with inline citations `(Source: title, YYYY-MM-DD, Credibility: X.X)`.

**Contradictions & Nuances**
* If sources disagree or add subtlety, show each side in bullets with citations.

**Citations**
: Already inline above; do not add a separate list.

Do not include any other text.

    {
      "question": "‚Ä¶",
      "summary_text": "‚Ä¶",
      "data_points": ["‚Ä¶", "‚Ä¶"],
      "contradictions": ["‚Ä¶"],

### üóúÔ∏è Orchestration Flow

1. **Planner** ‚Üí pass `{{user_query}}`.  
2. **Execution** ‚Üí loop over each bullet from Stage 1, injecting it as `{{stage1_question}}` along with Tavily (or other) search results.  
3. **Publisher** ‚Üí aggregate all Stage 2 outputs into `research_data` and generate the final report.

### üì¶ Ready to Drop-In

Each block is self-contained and safe for production use with LangChain agents, CrewAI, LlamaIndex, or a custom orchestrator.  
If you need code snippets (TypeScript/Python) for pipeline wiring or want to extend with Slack/DB sinks, let me know!
